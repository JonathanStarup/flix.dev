Technology:
- Programming with first-class Datalog constraints
- Linting
- Null
- Type-level booleans
- Complexity annotations
- How we track Flix compiler performance
- Currying the right way and the wrong way?
- The State of Flix 2020
- Transformations that preserve sanity. E.g. introducing a local variable cannot change anything globally.

Reflections:
- No Free Lunch (Simple or well-engineered)
- Sanity-- (e.g. in the style of PHP - a fractal of bad design).
- Negativity around PL design
